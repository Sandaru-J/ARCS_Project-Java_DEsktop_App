# ARCS (Automated Railway Control System)

ARCS is a groundbreaking software application developed using Java, designed to enhance the efficiency and safety of the existing railway transportation system. With a comprehensive range of solutions, ARCS provides railway operators and train drivers with real-time data and insights, empowering them to make informed decisions and optimize operations.

The system's core functionality revolves around providing train drivers with a thorough understanding of their route and crucial real-time information about other trains. By capturing and analyzing data from multiple metrics such as speed, distance, time, deceleration, acceleration, and train length, ARCS consolidates this information into a unified platform. Using this data, ARCS automatically generates digital directives and notifications, which are then delivered to train drivers based on their location and relevant attributes. This advanced communication system minimizes downtime and streamlines operations, reducing the discomfort caused by waiting times at railway crossings, junctions, and stations.

ARCS also employs cutting-edge technologies to ensure safety on the tracks. By integrating with Google APIs, the system tracks train locations, altitudes, and other vital details, enabling real-time monitoring and precise traffic management. Moreover, ARCS utilizes simulated traffic conditions derived from the collected data, equipping train drivers with valuable insights to overcome congestion effectively. Additionally, ARCS utilizes an alarm and lighting system to warn individuals crossing the tracks, ensuring their safety.

In summary, ARCS revolutionizes railway transportation by leveraging automation, real-time data analysis, and advanced technologies. With its comprehensive capabilities, ARCS optimizes operations, improves efficiency, and enhances safety, making it a trans-formative solution for the railway industry.
